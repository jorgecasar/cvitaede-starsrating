## Getting Started

Clone the repository. Install all dependencies with `bower install`. Then run `polymer serve` to serve your application locally.

### Prerequisites

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed.
Second, make sure you have [bower](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower) installed.

## Running the tests

```
$ polymer test
```

Your application is already set up to be tested via [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester). Run `polymer test` to run your application's test suite locally.


## Building Your Application

```
$ polymer build
```

This will create a `build/` folder with `bundled/` and `unbundled/` sub-folders
containing a bundled (Vulcanized) and unbundled builds, both run through HTML,
CSS, and JS optimizers.

You can serve the built versions by giving `polymer serve` a folder to serve
from:

```
$ polymer serve build/bundled
```
